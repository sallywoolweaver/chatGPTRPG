Lance grew up on the streets of a large city. He was always scrappy, getting into fights with the other kids in his neighborhood. He quickly learned how to throw a punch and how to take a hit. When he was sixteen, he met a man named Kurt who ran a local boxing gym. Kurt took Lance under his wing and taught him how to box. Lance quickly became the best fighter in the gym. He started entering underground boxing matches and making a name for himself.

When he was twenty-one, Lance was approached by a man named Viktor. Viktor was the leader of a small criminal organization. He offered Lance a job as a enforcer. Lance accepted and quickly rose through the ranks. He became Viktor's right-hand man.

Lance continued to work for Viktor for several years. He became known as one of the most ruthless fighters in the city. He would do whatever Viktor asked, no questions asked.

One day, Viktor asked Lance to kill a man who had been causing problems for his organization. Lance tracked the man down and killed him. But when he went to dispose of the body, he was caught by the police. He was sentenced to twenty years in prison.

Lance was released from prison after ten years. He was a changed man. He had learned his lesson and was determined to go straight. He started working at the boxing gym again and began training the next generation of fighters.
