My name is Zephyr. I was born in the year the world ended. My parents were some of the lucky ones, they survived the nuclear bombs that fell and the ensuing radiation that killed so many. They were able to find a safe place to live, hidden away from the prying eyes of the government. They taught me everything they could about the world before it ended, and how to survive in this new one.

I grew up hearing stories about the brave men and women who fought against the government, trying to take back our freedom. They were the ones who inspired me to do what I do now. I knew that I could never just sit by and do nothing while the people around me suffered.

So, I started to fight back. I began to gather information about the government's plans and share it with the resistance. I helped them plan and execute attacks against the government's forces. I became one of the most wanted people in the country.

But I was never caught. I was always one step ahead of them. And I will continue to fight until the day that the people are free.
